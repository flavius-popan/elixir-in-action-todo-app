# Elixir In Action Todo App

This is the final project from [Elixir in Action, Third Edition](tab:https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-third-edition) by Saša Jurić. It's a simple Todo app that uses core Elixir features and OTP principles to demonstrate how to build a concurrent application.

I've followed most of the code in the book, and used a generous heap of Anthropic credits to embiggen the test suite.
